# Simform Internship POC

This repository will be organized into folders based on each topic covered in the LMS. Each folder will contain relevant PoCs, code, and documentation specific to the respective topic. This structure ensures easy navigation and access to the materials learned throughout the internship.



## Flipkart Task


For the Flipkart task, since it involves HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I’ll create a folder named "html-css-bootstrap." Inside this folder, the Flipkart task will be stored as "flipkart-web.html" to keep it organized and easily accessible.[Flipkart-Website](https://github.com/Raj10203/Simform-Training-Work-Raj/blob/master/HTML-CSS-BOOSTRAP/html/flipkart-web.html)


## Git-hub Task

For the GitHub task, I’ll create a separate repository to keep it organized. You can click on the repository link to open it and access all the files related to the task.
